NEXTUP:


TODO:
-make a types header
-add error ports (they could handle the thrown errors)
-if we keep boost::variant, need to handle the bad gets
-probably need pImpl everywhere eventually
-remove some of the string matching


QUESTIONS:
-boost::variant the best way to handle the packets?  boost::get seems fine if we aren't manipulating the packet contents, and we cannot use visitors anyway because they are designed to avoid exposing the contents
-hide the port implementation?
-boost::ptr_map may be a bad idea b/c it internally uses void* as the pointer storage, but Container is abstract so there isn't a lot of choice
-will the port opening/closing I have work with multithreading?
